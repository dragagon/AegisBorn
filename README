<H1>Aegis Born MMO</H1>
This is designed to be a work on progress for an MMO built from scratch following along with the crafters haven blog. It is intended to be used to learn the ropes of:

<ul>
<li>SmartFoxServer</li>
<li>Symfony Integration with SmartFoxServer</li>
<li>Network Messaging</li>
</ul>

The idea behind this project is to start from scratch and build a web server, database, and MMO through Unity3d. It is a work in progress so things will be changing as they get built and talked about on the blog <a href="http://mmocraftershaven.blogspot.com/">CJR Gaming Design / Development</a>.
